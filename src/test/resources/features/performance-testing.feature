Feature: Performance and Load Testing for Feed Personalization
  As a platform administrator
  I want to ensure the feed personalization system maintains performance under load
  So that users receive fast and high-quality personalized content even during peak usage

  Background:
    Given the personalization service is available
    And performance monitoring is enabled
    And load testing fixtures are available

  Scenario: Basic response time for single user personalization
    Given I have a user with established preferences
    And the system has 1000 content items available
    When I request a personalized feed for a single user
    Then the response time should be less than 100 milliseconds
    And the feed should contain 25 relevant items
    And the personalization quality score should exceed 0.8

  Scenario: Response time with moderate concurrent users
    Given I have 100 concurrent users with different preference profiles
    And the system has 10000 content items available
    When all users simultaneously request personalized feeds
    Then 95% of requests should complete within 200 milliseconds
    And 99% of requests should complete within 500 milliseconds
    And all feeds should maintain personalization quality above 0.7
    And no requests should timeout or fail

  Scenario: High load concurrent user performance
    Given I have 1000 concurrent users with diverse preferences
    And the system has 50000 content items in the repository
    When all users request personalized feeds simultaneously
    Then the median response time should be less than 300 milliseconds
    And the 95th percentile response time should be less than 1 second
    And the system should maintain at least 90% personalization quality
    And the error rate should be less than 0.1%

  Scenario: Performance degradation under extreme load
    Given I gradually increase concurrent users from 1000 to 5000
    And the system has 100000 content items available
    When I monitor response times and quality during the load increase
    Then response times should degrade gracefully without sudden spikes
    And personalization quality should not drop below 0.6 even at peak load
    And the system should not crash or become unresponsive
    And resource utilization should remain within acceptable limits

  Scenario: Large dataset personalization performance
    Given I have a user with extensive engagement history (50000 interactions)
    And the system has 1 million content items to choose from
    When I request a personalized feed for this power user
    Then the response time should still be under 500 milliseconds
    And the feed should show higher personalization accuracy due to rich data
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable bounds
    And the personalization quality score should exceed 0.9

  Scenario: Cold start performance with minimal data
    Given I have 1000 new users with no engagement history
    And the system has 100000 content items available
    When all new users request their first personalized feeds
    Then each response should complete within 150 milliseconds
    And feeds should contain popular, high-quality content
    And the system should not struggle with lack of personalization data
    And baseline personalization quality should be at least 0.5

  Scenario: Performance with complex user preference profiles
    Given I have 500 users with highly detailed preference profiles
    And each user has preferences for 50+ topics with varying weights
    And the system has 200000 content items with rich metadata
    When these complex users request personalized feeds
    Then response times should remain under 400 milliseconds
    And the complexity should result in higher personalization quality
    And CPU usage should not spike excessively during complex matching
    And memory usage should scale linearly with profile complexity

  Scenario: Database query performance under load
    Given I have 2000 concurrent users requesting feeds
    And the system uses database-heavy personalization algorithms
    When I monitor database performance during peak load
    Then database query response times should average under 50 milliseconds
    And no database connection timeouts should occur
    And database connection pool should not be exhausted
    And query optimization should prevent N+1 query problems

  Scenario: Cache performance and hit rates under load
    Given I have a caching layer for personalization data
    And 3000 users with overlapping interest patterns
    When users request feeds over a sustained period
    Then cache hit rate should exceed 80% for user preferences
    And cache hit rate should exceed 70% for content metadata
    And cache misses should not significantly impact response times
    And cache eviction should not cause performance spikes

  Scenario: Memory usage growth with concurrent users
    Given I start with low system memory usage
    And I gradually add concurrent users up to 2000
    When I monitor memory usage throughout the load test
    Then memory usage should grow linearly with user count
    And memory should not leak or grow unboundedly
    And garbage collection should not cause significant pauses
    And system should maintain stable memory usage at steady state

  Scenario: Personalization quality degradation under time pressure
    Given I have a system configured with tight response time limits
    And 1500 concurrent users requesting feeds
    When the system is forced to optimize for speed over quality
    Then response times should meet the strict time limits
    And personalization quality should degrade gracefully
    And users should still receive reasonable content recommendations
    And the system should adapt personalization complexity based on time constraints

  Scenario: Throughput sustainability over extended periods
    Given I maintain 1000 concurrent users requesting feeds continuously
    And the test runs for 30 minutes at sustained load
    When I monitor system performance over the entire duration
    Then throughput should remain stable throughout the test
    And response times should not degrade over time
    And system resources should not show signs of exhaustion
    And no memory leaks or resource accumulation should occur

  Scenario: Peak traffic burst handling
    Given I have a baseline of 500 concurrent users
    And I simulate sudden traffic spikes to 3000 users
    When the traffic spike occurs and then returns to baseline
    Then the system should handle the spike without failing
    And response times should return to baseline levels after the spike
    And no users should experience service unavailability
    And the system should automatically scale resources if configured

  Scenario: Performance with real-time personalization updates
    Given I have 1000 active users receiving personalized feeds
    And users are actively engaging with content (likes, shares, comments)
    When I update user preferences in real-time based on interactions
    Then real-time preference updates should not impact feed response times
    And updated preferences should be reflected in subsequent feed requests
    And the system should handle the dual load of serving feeds and updating preferences
    And data consistency should be maintained during concurrent operations

  Scenario: Cross-system performance with external integrations
    Given the personalization system integrates with external content APIs
    And I have 800 concurrent users requesting feeds
    When external API response times are slower than normal
    Then the personalization system should not be blocked by slow external calls
    And circuit breakers should prevent cascade failures
    And fallback mechanisms should provide degraded but functional service
    And overall system response times should remain acceptable

  Scenario: Content ingestion performance impact
    Given the system is actively ingesting 1000 new content items per minute
    And I have 1200 concurrent users requesting personalized feeds
    When content ingestion and feed personalization occur simultaneously
    Then feed response times should not be significantly impacted by ingestion
    And new content should be available for personalization within reasonable time
    And system resources should be fairly allocated between ingestion and serving
    And no resource contention should cause service degradation

  Scenario: Personalization algorithm scalability comparison
    Given I have multiple personalization algorithms available (simple, complex, ML-based)
    And 1000 concurrent users with varying computational complexity needs
    When I benchmark each algorithm under the same load conditions
    Then I should measure response time differences between algorithms
    And quality differences should be quantified for each algorithm
    And resource usage should be compared across algorithms
    And recommendations should be provided for algorithm selection based on load

  Scenario: Multi-tenant performance isolation
    Given the system serves multiple client organizations (tenants)
    And Tenant A has 500 concurrent users, Tenant B has 1500 concurrent users
    When both tenants experience peak load simultaneously
    Then each tenant's performance should be isolated from the other
    And resource allocation should be fair or based on service level agreements
    And one tenant's load should not degrade another tenant's service quality
    And performance metrics should be tracked separately per tenant

  Scenario: Performance monitoring and alerting validation
    Given I have performance monitoring and alerting configured
    And I simulate various load conditions and performance issues
    When performance thresholds are exceeded
    Then appropriate alerts should be triggered within acceptable time
    And monitoring data should accurately reflect system performance
    And performance dashboards should update in real-time
    And alert notifications should contain relevant diagnostic information

  Scenario: Auto-scaling performance validation
    Given the system is configured with auto-scaling capabilities
    And I start with minimal resource allocation
    When I gradually increase load beyond current capacity
    Then auto-scaling should trigger before performance degrades significantly
    And new resources should be provisioned and integrated smoothly
    And performance should improve as new resources come online
    And scaling decisions should be based on appropriate performance metrics
