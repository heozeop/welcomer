Feature: Error Handling and Resilience for Feed Personalization
  As a feed personalization system
  I want to handle errors gracefully and maintain service resilience
  So that users continue to receive content even when components fail

  Background:
    Given the feed personalization system is running
    And test data is available for error handling scenarios
    And error simulation capabilities are configured

  Scenario: Database connection timeout during feed generation
    Given a user with established preferences requests a personalized feed
    And the database connection is configured to timeout after 100ms
    When the user requests their personalized feed
    And the database query exceeds the timeout limit
    Then the system should return a fallback feed within 2 seconds
    And the fallback feed should contain popular trending content
    And the response should indicate degraded service status
    And an error should be logged with appropriate details

  Scenario: Database completely unavailable during feed request
    Given a user requests a personalized feed
    And the database is completely unavailable
    When the user requests their personalized feed
    Then the system should return a cached or static fallback feed
    And the fallback content should be appropriate for general audiences
    And the response time should not exceed 3 seconds
    And the system should indicate service degradation in the response
    And database availability should be monitored for recovery

  Scenario: Personalization service returns corrupted data
    Given a user with strong topic preferences
    And the personalization service is configured to return corrupted data
    When the user requests their personalized feed
    Then the system should detect the data corruption
    And the system should fallback to basic content ranking
    And the feed should contain valid, well-formed content
    And corrupted data should be logged and reported
    And the system should continue serving subsequent requests normally

  Scenario: Personalization algorithm crashes during processing
    Given a user requests personalized content
    And the personalization algorithm is configured to crash
    When the feed generation process starts
    And the algorithm encounters a critical error
    Then the system should catch the exception gracefully
    And the system should serve content using a simpler ranking algorithm
    And the response should be delivered within acceptable time limits
    And the error should be logged with full stack trace details
    And the system should automatically retry with fallback logic

  Scenario: Content retrieval service experiences high latency
    Given multiple users are requesting personalized feeds simultaneously
    And the content retrieval service has artificial latency of 5 seconds
    When users request their feeds within a 10-second window
    Then requests should timeout appropriately after 3 seconds
    And users should receive cached or fallback content immediately
    And the system should not queue requests indefinitely
    And circuit breakers should activate to prevent cascading failures
    And service health metrics should reflect the degraded state

  Scenario: Memory exhaustion during large feed generation
    Given the system has limited memory resources
    And a user requests a very large personalized feed
    When the feed generation process consumes excessive memory
    And memory usage approaches system limits
    Then the system should limit the feed size appropriately
    And memory usage should be controlled to prevent system crashes
    And the user should receive a partial feed with appropriate messaging
    And garbage collection should be triggered to free resources
    And system monitoring should alert on high memory usage

  Scenario: External recommendation service is unavailable
    Given a user who typically receives ML-powered recommendations
    And the external recommendation service is completely down
    When the user requests their personalized feed
    Then the system should detect the service unavailability
    And the feed should be generated using internal algorithms
    And content quality should remain acceptable despite service outage
    And the system should periodically check for service recovery
    And users should be unaware of the backend service failure

  Scenario: Cache corruption leads to invalid feed data
    Given the feed cache contains corrupted data for a user
    And the user requests their personalized feed
    When the system attempts to retrieve cached feed data
    Then the system should detect the cache corruption
    And the corrupted cache entry should be invalidated immediately
    And a fresh feed should be generated from source data
    And the new feed should be cached with validation checksums
    And cache health monitoring should be notified of the corruption

  Scenario: API rate limiting kicks in during high traffic
    Given the system is experiencing unusually high traffic
    And API rate limits are configured at 1000 requests per minute per user
    When a user exceeds their rate limit within the time window
    Then the user should receive a proper rate limiting response
    And the response should include retry-after headers
    And the system should serve cached content if available
    And rate limiting should be applied fairly across all users
    And system performance should remain stable under rate limiting

  Scenario: Gradual service recovery after complete outage
    Given all personalization services are down for maintenance
    And users are receiving only cached or fallback content
    When personalization services begin coming back online gradually
    Then the system should detect service recovery automatically
    And traffic should be gradually shifted back to recovered services
    And service health checks should validate recovered functionality
    And users should seamlessly transition back to personalized content
    And recovery metrics should be collected and monitored

  Scenario: Partial service failure with mixed service health
    Given the personalization system has multiple service dependencies
    And 50% of the recommendation services are failing
    And user preference services are functioning normally
    When users request personalized feeds during this partial outage
    Then the system should identify which services are healthy
    And feeds should be generated using available healthy services
    And content quality should degrade gracefully but remain functional
    And the system should load balance around failed services
    And recovery attempts should continue in the background

  Scenario: Invalid user preference data causes processing errors
    Given a user has corrupted or invalid preference data in their profile
    And the preference data contains malformed or inconsistent values
    When the system attempts to generate a personalized feed
    Then the system should validate preference data before processing
    And invalid preferences should be filtered out or corrected
    And the user should still receive a reasonable personalized feed
    And data validation errors should be logged and reported
    And the system should attempt to reconstruct valid preferences

  Scenario: Feed generation timeout under normal conditions
    Given the system has standard timeout configurations
    And a user requests a personalized feed
    When feed generation takes longer than the configured timeout
    Then the system should gracefully cancel the long-running operation
    And a fallback feed should be served within the timeout period
    And resources should be properly cleaned up after cancellation
    And timeout events should be logged and analyzed
    And the user should receive appropriate messaging about the delay

  Scenario: Concurrent feed requests cause resource contention
    Given multiple users are requesting feeds simultaneously
    And the system has limited processing resources
    When concurrent requests cause resource contention
    Then the system should implement appropriate queuing mechanisms
    And response times should remain within acceptable limits
    And resource usage should be monitored and controlled
    And users should not experience indefinite delays
    And the system should scale processing based on demand

  Scenario: Content moderation service failure affects feed safety
    Given the content moderation service becomes unavailable
    And potentially inappropriate content exists in the content pool
    When users request personalized feeds
    Then the system should apply conservative content filtering
    And only pre-approved or previously moderated content should be served
    And feed safety should be maintained even without active moderation
    And fallback moderation rules should be applied automatically
    And service recovery should restore full moderation capabilities

  Scenario: Network partition isolates part of the system
    Given the system is distributed across multiple network zones
    And a network partition isolates one zone from others
    When users in the isolated zone request personalized feeds
    Then local caching and fallback mechanisms should activate
    And users should continue receiving feeds despite network issues
    And the system should detect and adapt to network partition conditions
    And service should automatically resume when network connectivity is restored
    And partition recovery should not cause data inconsistencies

  Scenario: Configuration service failure affects personalization settings
    Given personalization algorithms depend on configuration settings
    And the configuration service becomes unavailable
    When the system needs to access personalization parameters
    Then cached or default configuration should be used automatically
    And personalization should continue with reasonable default settings
    And configuration changes should be queued until service recovery
    And the system should not crash or fail due to configuration unavailability
    And alerts should be generated for prolonged configuration service outages

  Scenario: Gradual performance degradation before complete failure
    Given system performance is slowly degrading over time
    And response times are gradually increasing
    When performance metrics cross warning thresholds
    Then the system should automatically implement protective measures
    And non-essential features should be disabled to preserve core functionality
    And users should be notified of temporary service limitations
    And automatic scaling or failover should be initiated if available
    And system health should be monitored closely during degradation

  Scenario: Recovery validation after service restoration
    Given multiple services have been restored after an outage
    And the system is transitioning back to normal operations
    When users begin requesting personalized feeds again
    Then the system should validate that recovered services are functioning correctly
    And feed quality should be monitored during the recovery period
    And any anomalies or issues should trigger immediate alerts
    And gradual traffic increase should verify system stability
    And full service restoration should be confirmed before declaring complete recovery

  Scenario: Error handling with upstream service dependencies
    Given the personalization system depends on multiple upstream services
    And one upstream service begins returning errors intermittently
    When the system processes feed requests during this instability
    Then errors from upstream services should be handled gracefully
    And the system should implement exponential backoff for retries
    And alternative data sources should be used when primary sources fail
    And error rates should be monitored and reported
    And circuit breaker patterns should prevent cascading failures

  Scenario: Data consistency during partial system failures
    Given user interactions are being recorded during a partial system outage
    And some user preference updates are failing to persist
    When the system recovers from the partial failure
    Then data consistency checks should be performed automatically
    And any missing or inconsistent data should be identified
    And user preferences should be reconstructed from available interaction logs
    And data integrity should be validated before resuming normal operations
    And users should not lose their personalization progress due to system failures

  Scenario: Monitoring and alerting during error conditions
    Given the system is experiencing various types of errors and failures
    And monitoring systems are configured to track service health
    When errors occur across different system components
    Then appropriate alerts should be generated for different error types
    And alert severity should match the impact on user experience
    And error metrics should be collected and analyzed for patterns
    And dashboards should provide real-time visibility into system health
    And automated responses should be triggered for critical error conditions

  Scenario: User experience during prolonged service degradation
    Given the system has been running in degraded mode for an extended period
    And users are receiving fallback content with limited personalization
    When users continue to interact with the system during degradation
    Then user engagement and satisfaction should be monitored
    And communication about service limitations should be clear and helpful
    And efforts to restore full functionality should be prioritized
    And user feedback should be collected and analyzed during outages
    And service level agreements should be maintained as much as possible

  Scenario: Automated failover to backup data centers
    Given the primary data center experiences a critical failure
    And backup data centers are available with replicated data
    When automatic failover is triggered due to primary datacenter outage
    Then users should be seamlessly redirected to backup systems
    And personalization data should be synchronized across data centers
    And service continuity should be maintained during failover
    And failover time should be within acceptable recovery time objectives
    And the system should operate normally from backup infrastructure

  Scenario: Security incident response during personalization failures
    Given a security incident affects personalization system components
    And potentially compromised data may impact feed generation
    When security measures require immediate service restrictions
    Then personalization should be disabled temporarily if necessary
    And users should receive generic, safe content during security response
    And audit logs should be maintained for security investigation
    And service restoration should follow security clearance procedures
    And user data protection should be prioritized throughout the incident response

  Scenario: Resource exhaustion prevention under load
    Given the system is approaching resource capacity limits
    And request volume continues to increase beyond normal levels
    When resource utilization reaches critical thresholds
    Then request throttling should be implemented to protect system stability
    And resource usage should be optimized automatically where possible
    And non-critical operations should be deferred or cancelled
    And users should receive appropriate messaging about service limitations
    And capacity scaling should be initiated to handle increased demand

  Scenario: Error recovery with machine learning model failures
    Given personalization relies on trained ML models for recommendations
    And the primary ML models become corrupted or start producing poor results
    When the system detects model performance degradation
    Then fallback models or rule-based algorithms should be activated
    And model performance should be continuously monitored and validated
    And poor-performing models should be automatically replaced
    And model retraining should be initiated to restore full functionality
    And users should continue receiving reasonable recommendations during model recovery
