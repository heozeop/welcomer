# SNS Feed System - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview  
The SNS Feed System is the core content discovery and engagement component of a social networking service. It enables users to view, interact with, and contribute to a dynamic, personalized feed of content from their network, communities, and recommended sources.  

**Problem it solves:**  
- Aggregates diverse content into a single, continuously updated interface.  
- Surfaces the most relevant and engaging posts to each user based on personalization algorithms.  
- Encourages user engagement through interactive elements such as likes, comments, and shares.  

**Target audience:**  
- Social media users seeking real-time updates and curated content.  
- Content creators aiming to reach their audience effectively.  
- Platform operators who require scalable and performant content delivery systems.  

**Value proposition:**  
- Increases user retention through continuous, personalized engagement.  
- Encourages frequent content creation and interaction.  
- Provides a foundation for monetization via ads and sponsored posts.

## Core Features  

### 1. Personalized Feed Ranking  
- **What it does:** Displays posts in a relevance-based order tailored to each user.  
- **Why it's important:** Keeps users engaged by surfacing the most relevant content first.  
- **How it works:** Uses a ranking algorithm that considers recency, user interactions, content type, and social graph data.  

### 2. Infinite Scrolling with Lazy Loading  
- **What it does:** Continuously loads new posts as the user scrolls down.  
- **Why it's important:** Improves user experience by removing pagination and reducing initial load time.  
- **How it works:** Implements client-side lazy loading, fetching additional posts via API when scroll thresholds are reached.  

### 3. Real-Time Content Updates  
- **What it does:** Updates the feed instantly when new relevant content becomes available.  
- **Why it's important:** Maintains a "live" feel and increases time spent on the platform.  
- **How it works:** Uses WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to push new content without requiring a page refresh.  

### 4. Post Interaction (Like, Comment, Share)  
- **What it does:** Allows users to engage with posts directly from the feed.  
- **Why it's important:** Drives social interaction and retention.  
- **How it works:** API endpoints handle interaction events; UI updates optimistically before server confirmation.  

### 5. Content Filtering and Segmentation  
- **What it does:** Enables filtering by content type (e.g., text, images, videos) or topic.  
- **Why it's important:** Gives users control over their feed experience.  
- **How it works:** Applies client-side filters combined with backend query parameters.  

### 6. Ad and Sponsored Post Integration (Future Phase)  
- **What it does:** Displays targeted ads within the feed.  
- **Why it's important:** Generates revenue while maintaining content relevance.  
- **How it works:** Ads are inserted into the feed algorithmically, respecting frequency caps and targeting rules.

## User Experience  

### User Personas  
1. **Casual User:** Logs in daily to browse updates and occasionally interacts with posts.  
2. **Power User / Creator:** Actively posts content, engages with followers, and seeks to grow an audience.  
3. **Advertiser / Brand:** Uses sponsored posts to reach targeted demographics.  

### Key User Flows  
1. **Browsing the Feed:**  
   - Open the app → Feed loads personalized posts → Scroll to view more content → Real-time updates appear.  
2. **Interacting with a Post:**  
   - Tap "Like" → UI updates instantly → Server confirms interaction.  
3. **Filtering Content:**  
   - User selects a category → Feed updates to show only matching posts.  

### UI/UX Considerations  
- Prioritize speed and smooth scrolling performance.  
- Use skeleton loaders for better perceived performance.  
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).  
- Maintain a clean and uncluttered layout with distinct visual hierarchy.

## Technical Architecture  

### System Components  
- **Frontend:** SPA (React/Vue/Next.js) with infinite scroll and WebSocket listeners.  
- **Backend API:** Node.js/NestJS (or similar) with GraphQL/REST endpoints.  
- **Feed Ranking Service:** Dedicated microservice for ranking algorithms.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL for core data; Redis for caching hot content.  
- **Real-Time Messaging:** WebSockets (Socket.io) or Server-Sent Events for live updates.  
- **Search & Filtering:** Elasticsearch or OpenSearch for advanced queries.  

### Data Models (Simplified)  
**User**  
- `id`, `username`, `profile_pic`, `preferences`  

**Post**  
- `id`, `author_id`, `content_type`, `content_url`, `caption`, `created_at`, `engagement_counts`  

**Engagement**  
- `id`, `user_id`, `post_id`, `type` (like, comment, share), `created_at`  

### APIs and Integrations  
- `GET /feed` - Retrieve personalized feed.  
- `POST /interaction` - Like, comment, or share a post.  
- `GET /feed/filters` - Fetch filtered feed data.  
- WebSocket channel: `feed_updates` - Push new content to connected clients.  

### Infrastructure Requirements  
- Load balancer for API scalability.  
- CDN for static content delivery.  
- Cache layer (Redis) for hot feed data.  
- Horizontal scaling for real-time updates.

## Risks and Mitigations  

- **Technical challenge:** Ranking algorithm complexity → Start with simple recency + engagement model, evolve later.  
- **MVP scope creep:** Clearly define essential features and defer advanced features.  
- **Resource constraints:** Use modular architecture to allow parallel development across teams.
