# Task ID: 1
# Title: Define System Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive system architecture document for the SNS default feed system, outlining all major components and their interactions.
# Details:
The architecture document should include:
1. High-level system diagram showing all components
2. Data flow diagrams
3. Component responsibilities
4. Technology stack selection (databases, caching layers, message queues)
5. Scalability considerations
6. Infrastructure requirements (cloud services, server specifications)
7. Security architecture

The document should follow a microservices approach if appropriate for scalability, with clear separation of concerns between feed generation, content storage, user preference management, and delivery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Review the architecture document with technical stakeholders to validate completeness, scalability, and alignment with industry best practices. Create a checklist of architectural requirements and verify each component against it.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create High-Level System Diagram and Component Breakdown [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design a comprehensive high-level system diagram showing all major components of the SNS feed system and define the responsibilities of each component.
### Details:
Create a system diagram using architecture modeling tools (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart) that illustrates all major components including: content service, user service, feed generation service, engagement tracking, notification system, and API gateway. For each component, document its primary responsibilities, interfaces, and how it interacts with other components. Follow microservices principles with clear boundaries between services. Include both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns between services.

## 2. Define Data Flow and Technology Stack [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create detailed data flow diagrams and select the appropriate technology stack for each component of the system.
### Details:
Develop data flow diagrams showing how information moves through the system for key operations (post creation, feed generation, user engagement). For each component identified in subtask 1, select specific technologies: databases (consider PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for content, Redis for caching), message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ for event streaming), compute resources (container orchestration with Kubernetes), and storage solutions. Justify each technology choice based on requirements for scalability, performance, and maintainability. Document data retention policies and data lifecycle management.

## 3. Design Scalability and Infrastructure Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the scalability approach and detailed infrastructure requirements for the SNS feed system.
### Details:
Document horizontal and vertical scaling strategies for each component. Define auto-scaling policies based on load metrics. Specify infrastructure requirements including: cloud provider services (AWS/GCP/Azure), compute resources (instance types, memory/CPU requirements), storage needs (volume sizes, IOPS requirements), networking configuration (load balancers, CDN integration), and regional distribution strategy. Include capacity planning calculations based on projected user growth and engagement patterns. Design for high availability with appropriate redundancy and failover mechanisms.

## 4. Develop Security Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design a comprehensive security architecture for the SNS feed system addressing authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance requirements.
### Details:
Define the authentication system (OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens), authorization framework (role-based/attribute-based access control), and API security measures. Document data protection strategies including encryption (at rest and in transit), PII handling, and compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA). Design security monitoring and incident response procedures. Include network security controls (firewalls, WAF, DDoS protection), secure coding practices, and vulnerability management approach. Create a threat model identifying potential attack vectors and mitigation strategies.

## 5. Compile Final Architecture Document [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Consolidate all architectural components into a comprehensive architecture document with implementation recommendations and migration strategy.
### Details:
Create a final architecture document that integrates all previous subtasks into a cohesive whole. Include an executive summary, architectural principles, detailed component descriptions, data models, API contracts between services, and implementation roadmap. Document non-functional requirements (performance SLAs, reliability targets, scalability metrics). Add deployment architecture diagrams showing staging and production environments. Include a phased implementation plan with milestones and dependencies. Document operational considerations including monitoring, alerting, and disaster recovery procedures.
