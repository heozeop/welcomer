# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Feed Generation Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core algorithm that determines what content appears in a user's default feed and in what order.
# Details:
Implement a configurable feed generation algorithm that:
1. Ranks content based on multiple factors (recency, popularity, relevance)
2. Personalizes based on user preferences and behavior
3. Balances diversity of content sources
4. Handles cold-start problems for new users
5. Supports A/B testing of algorithm variations

Implementation details:
```
class FeedAlgorithm {
  constructor(userPreferenceService, contentRepository, engagementService) {
    this.userPreferenceService = userPreferenceService;
    this.contentRepository = contentRepository;
    this.engagementService = engagementService;
    this.weights = {
      recency: 0.5,
      popularity: 0.3,
      relevance: 0.2
    };
  }
  
  async generateFeed(userId, options = {}) {
    const userPreferences = await this.userPreferenceService.getPreferences(userId);
    const candidateContent = await this.contentRepository.getCandidateContent(options.limit * 3);
    
    // Score each content item
    const scoredContent = await Promise.all(candidateContent.map(async (content) => {
      const recencyScore = this.calculateRecencyScore(content.createdAt);
      const popularityScore = await this.engagementService.getPopularityScore(content.id);
      const relevanceScore = this.calculateRelevanceScore(content, userPreferences);
      
      const totalScore = 
        (recencyScore * this.weights.recency) +
        (popularityScore * this.weights.popularity) +
        (relevanceScore * this.weights.relevance);
        
      return { content, score: totalScore };
    }));
    
    // Sort by score and apply diversity rules
    const rankedContent = this.applyDiversityRules(scoredContent.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score));
    
    // Return top N items
    return rankedContent.slice(0, options.limit).map(item => item.content);
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual scoring components. Integration tests with mock data to verify ranking behavior. A/B testing framework to compare algorithm variations. Metrics collection to evaluate feed quality (engagement rates, time spent, diversity measures).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Scoring Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core scoring functions for content ranking based on recency, popularity, and relevance factors.
### Details:
Create methods to calculate individual scores:
1. Implement `calculateRecencyScore(createdAt)` that returns higher scores for newer content using a decay function
2. Implement `calculateRelevanceScore(content, userPreferences)` that compares content attributes with user preferences
3. Integrate with the engagement service to retrieve popularity scores
4. Normalize all scores to a 0-1 range for consistent weighting
5. Add configuration options for adjusting the weight parameters

## 2. Develop Content Diversity Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create algorithms to ensure feed diversity by preventing overrepresentation of similar content or sources.
### Details:
Implement the `applyDiversityRules(scoredContent)` method that:
1. Groups content by source, topic, and content type
2. Applies penalties to similar content appearing too close together
3. Ensures representation from multiple sources
4. Maintains a balance of content types (e.g., text, images, videos)
5. Preserves overall quality by making minimal adjustments to high-scoring content

## 3. Implement Cold-Start Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to generate quality feeds for new users with limited preference data.
### Details:
Extend the FeedAlgorithm class to handle new users:
1. Add detection for users with insufficient preference or history data
2. Implement fallback strategies using trending content and broad appeal items
3. Create a progressive personalization approach that gradually increases personalization as user data accumulates
4. Add demographic-based initial recommendations if basic user information is available
5. Include diverse content sampling to quickly learn user preferences

## 4. Build A/B Testing Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Add support for running multiple algorithm variants and directing users to different experiment groups.
### Details:
Enhance the FeedAlgorithm class to support experimentation:
1. Modify the constructor to accept experiment parameters
2. Create variant implementations of scoring and ranking functions
3. Add experiment ID and variant tracking to feed generation
4. Implement parameter overrides based on experiment configuration
5. Add logging of key metrics for experiment analysis
6. Ensure consistent user experience within experiment groups

## 5. Optimize Feed Generation Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Improve the efficiency and scalability of the feed generation algorithm for production use.
### Details:
Optimize the feed generation process:
1. Implement caching for frequently accessed data (user preferences, popularity scores)
2. Add batch processing for scoring multiple content items efficiently
3. Implement pagination and lazy loading strategies for large content sets
4. Add background pre-computation of feeds for active users
5. Optimize database queries used in content selection
6. Add performance monitoring and logging
7. Implement circuit breakers for dependent services
