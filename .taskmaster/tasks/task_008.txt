# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Caching Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a caching strategy to improve feed loading performance and reduce database load.
# Details:
Develop a multi-level caching system that:
1. Caches feed results for quick retrieval
2. Implements cache invalidation strategies when new content is available
3. Uses distributed caching for scalability
4. Optimizes cache hit rates through analytics

Implementation should include:
```
class FeedCacheService {
  constructor(cacheProvider, feedService) {
    this.cache = cacheProvider;
    this.feedService = feedService;
    this.defaultTTL = 300; // 5 minutes
  }
  
  async getFeed(userId, options = {}) {
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(userId, options);
    
    // Try to get from cache
    const cachedFeed = await this.cache.get(cacheKey);
    if (cachedFeed) return cachedFeed;
    
    // Generate feed if not in cache
    const feed = await this.feedService.generateFeed(userId, options);
    
    // Store in cache with appropriate TTL
    const ttl = this.calculateTTL(userId, options);
    await this.cache.set(cacheKey, feed, ttl);
    
    return feed;
  }
  
  async invalidateCache(userId) {
    // Find all cache keys for this user
    const userCacheKeys = await this.cache.findKeys(`user:${userId}:*`);
    
    // Delete all matching keys
    await Promise.all(userCacheKeys.map(key => this.cache.delete(key)));
  }
}
```

The caching system should use Redis or a similar in-memory data store for primary caching, with CDN caching for static content.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for cache operations and key generation. Integration tests for cache hit/miss scenarios. Performance testing to measure cache effectiveness. Monitoring to track cache hit rates and invalidation frequency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Redis Cache Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Redis-based cache provider that will serve as the primary caching mechanism for the feed service.
### Details:
Implement a RedisCache class that handles connection to Redis, provides methods for get, set, delete, and findKeys operations. Include connection pooling, error handling, and reconnection logic. The class should implement a common interface that can be used by the FeedCacheService. Configure Redis with appropriate persistence settings and memory management policies.

## 2. Implement FeedCacheService Core Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement the core FeedCacheService class with caching and retrieval logic for feed data.
### Details:
Complete the implementation of the FeedCacheService class, focusing on the getFeed method, generateCacheKey method, and calculateTTL method. The generateCacheKey should create unique keys based on userId and feed options. The calculateTTL method should determine appropriate cache expiration times based on content type, user activity level, and feed freshness requirements.

## 3. Implement Cache Invalidation Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop a comprehensive cache invalidation system that ensures users see fresh content when available.
### Details:
Enhance the invalidateCache method to support different invalidation strategies: 1) User-specific invalidation when user preferences change, 2) Content-based invalidation when new content relevant to a user is created, 3) Time-based invalidation for different content types. Implement a pub/sub mechanism to receive invalidation events from other services. Add selective invalidation to avoid clearing the entire cache unnecessarily.

## 4. Implement Distributed Caching with Sharding [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Extend the caching system to support distributed operation across multiple cache servers with data sharding.
### Details:
Implement a sharding strategy that distributes cache data across multiple Redis instances. Create a ShardedRedisCache class that extends the base RedisCache implementation. Implement consistent hashing for key distribution to minimize cache misses during scaling events. Add support for cache replication and failover to ensure high availability.

## 5. Implement Cache Analytics and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create a system to track cache performance metrics and automatically optimize caching parameters.
### Details:
Implement a CacheAnalytics class that tracks metrics such as hit rate, miss rate, latency, and memory usage. Add instrumentation to the FeedCacheService to record these metrics. Create an optimization system that adjusts TTL values, cache size limits, and invalidation strategies based on observed patterns. Implement a dashboard to visualize cache performance metrics. Add adaptive caching that learns from usage patterns to predict which items should be cached longer.
