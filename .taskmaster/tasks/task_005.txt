# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Feed API Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the API service that delivers personalized feed content to clients and handles pagination, filtering, and feed refreshes.
# Details:
Create a RESTful API service that:
1. Authenticates users and validates requests
2. Retrieves personalized feed content using the feed algorithm
3. Supports pagination and infinite scrolling
4. Handles feed refreshes and updates
5. Provides filtering options
6. Implements caching for performance

API endpoints should include:
```
GET /api/v1/feed - Get user's default feed
GET /api/v1/feed/refresh - Get new content since last feed load
GET /api/v1/feed/explore - Get discovery feed with more diverse content
```

Implementation should use a web framework with middleware for:
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Response caching
- Error handling
- Logging and monitoring

The service should implement efficient pagination using cursor-based pagination rather than offset-based for better performance with large datasets.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for API controllers and middleware. Integration tests for the full request/response cycle. Performance testing to ensure response times meet requirements under load. API contract tests to verify the service meets client requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Authentication and Request Validation Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware components for authenticating users and validating incoming requests to the feed API. This includes JWT validation, permission checking, and request parameter validation.
### Details:
Develop middleware functions that: 1) Extract and validate JWT tokens from request headers, 2) Verify user permissions for accessing feed endpoints, 3) Validate query parameters for pagination, filtering, and other options, 4) Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Use a middleware pattern compatible with the chosen web framework. Create reusable validation schemas for different endpoint requirements.

## 2. Develop Core Feed Retrieval Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement the primary feed API endpoints that retrieve personalized content using the feed algorithm, including the default feed and explore feed endpoints.
### Details:
Create controller handlers for GET /api/v1/feed and GET /api/v1/feed/explore endpoints. Integrate with the Feed Generation Algorithm (Task 4) to retrieve personalized content. Implement cursor-based pagination using parameters like cursor_id and limit. Structure the response format to include feed items and pagination metadata (next_cursor, has_more). Add appropriate error handling for algorithm failures or empty results.

## 3. Implement Feed Refresh Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create the endpoint and logic for retrieving only new content since the last feed load, enabling efficient feed refreshes without duplicating content.
### Details:
Develop the GET /api/v1/feed/refresh endpoint that accepts a timestamp or cursor of the last retrieved item. Modify the feed algorithm integration to filter for content newer than the provided reference point. Implement optimized queries that only fetch new content rather than regenerating the entire feed. Add proper headers for cache control to prevent unnecessary refreshes.

## 4. Add Filtering and Sorting Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Enhance the feed API to support various filtering and sorting options, allowing clients to customize the feed based on content types, topics, or other attributes.
### Details:
Extend the existing endpoints to accept query parameters for filtering (content_type, topic, source, etc.) and sorting (recent, popular, relevant). Create filter processors that translate query parameters into algorithm inputs. Implement validation for filter combinations to prevent performance issues. Document all available filter options in the API specification.

## 5. Implement Response Caching and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add caching mechanisms and performance optimizations to ensure the feed API can handle high traffic loads with minimal latency.
### Details:
Implement response caching using Redis or a similar in-memory cache. Create cache keys based on user ID, pagination parameters, and filter options. Set appropriate cache expiration times based on content update frequency. Add cache invalidation triggers when new content is published. Implement request collapsing for concurrent identical requests. Add compression for response payloads. Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes and query plans.
