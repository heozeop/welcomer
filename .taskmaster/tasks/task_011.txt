# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop A/B Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a framework for A/B testing different feed algorithms, layouts, and features to optimize user engagement.
# Details:
Build an A/B testing system that:
1. Assigns users to test groups
2. Applies different feed algorithms or parameters to each group
3. Measures and compares performance metrics
4. Provides statistical analysis of results

Implementation should include:
```
class ABTestingService {
  async assignUserToExperiment(userId, experimentId) {
    // Get experiment configuration
    const experiment = await this.experimentRepository.getById(experimentId);
    if (!experiment.isActive) return null;
    
    // Check if user is already assigned
    const existingAssignment = await this.assignmentRepository.getAssignment(userId, experimentId);
    if (existingAssignment) return existingAssignment.variant;
    
    // Assign to variant based on consistent hashing
    const variantIndex = this.hashUserToVariant(userId, experiment.variants.length);
    const variant = experiment.variants[variantIndex];
    
    // Record assignment
    await this.assignmentRepository.createAssignment(userId, experimentId, variant);
    
    return variant;
  }
  
  async getExperimentResults(experimentId) {
    const experiment = await this.experimentRepository.getById(experimentId);
    const metrics = await this.metricsRepository.getMetricsByExperiment(experimentId);
    
    // Calculate statistical significance
    const analysis = this.performStatisticalAnalysis(metrics, experiment.variants);
    
    return {
      experiment,
      variantPerformance: analysis.variantPerformance,
      winner: analysis.winner,
      confidence: analysis.confidence
    };
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for user assignment and variant selection. Integration tests for the full experiment flow. Statistical validation of analysis methods. Verification that experiment results correctly influence product decisions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Experiment Configuration Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a repository for storing and retrieving A/B test experiment configurations, including variants, targeting rules, and experiment status.
### Details:
Create an ExperimentRepository class that handles CRUD operations for experiment configurations. The repository should store experiment metadata including name, description, start/end dates, variants, and targeting criteria. Implement methods for creating, updating, retrieving, and listing active experiments. Each experiment should have a unique ID, a set of variants (control and treatment groups), and configuration parameters that define what changes for each variant.

## 2. Develop User Assignment Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Build the service that consistently assigns users to experiment variants and persists these assignments.
### Details:
Implement the assignUserToExperiment method in the ABTestingService class that deterministically assigns users to experiment variants using consistent hashing. Create an AssignmentRepository to store and retrieve user assignments. Ensure that users remain in the same variant throughout an experiment unless explicitly reassigned. Implement bucketing logic that evenly distributes users across variants while maintaining the ability to target specific user segments based on attributes.

## 3. Create Metrics Collection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Develop a system to collect and aggregate performance metrics for each experiment variant.
### Details:
Implement a MetricsRepository class that captures and stores performance data for each experiment variant. Create methods to record metrics like click-through rates, engagement time, conversion events, and custom KPIs. Design the system to efficiently aggregate metrics by experiment, variant, and time period. Include functionality to normalize metrics based on user counts in each variant and to filter outliers.

## 4. Implement Statistical Analysis Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Build the statistical analysis component that evaluates experiment results and determines statistical significance.
### Details:
Implement the performStatisticalAnalysis method that compares metrics between experiment variants. Include calculations for p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes. Support multiple statistical methods appropriate for different metric types (e.g., t-tests for continuous metrics, chi-square for conversion rates). Implement visualization data preparation for experiment results. Add functionality to detect when an experiment has reached statistical significance.

## 5. Create Experiment Results Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Develop a dashboard interface for viewing experiment results, statistical analysis, and making decisions based on experiment outcomes.
### Details:
Implement the getExperimentResults method that returns comprehensive experiment results. Create a data structure that includes experiment details, variant performance metrics, statistical analysis results, and recommendations. Design the output to support visualization in a dashboard. Include functionality to export results and generate reports. Add features to help stakeholders make decisions based on experiment outcomes, such as recommended actions and projected impact of implementing winning variants.
