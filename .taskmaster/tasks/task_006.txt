# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement User Preference Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system for managing user preferences that affect feed content and personalization.
# Details:
Develop a user preference management system that:
1. Stores explicit user preferences (topics, followed accounts, content types)
2. Infers implicit preferences from user behavior
3. Provides APIs for updating preferences
4. Notifies the feed system when preferences change

Implementation should include:
```
class UserPreferenceService {
  async getPreferences(userId) {
    // Get explicit preferences from database
    const explicitPreferences = await this.preferenceRepository.getForUser(userId);
    
    // Get implicit preferences from behavior analysis
    const implicitPreferences = await this.behaviorAnalysisService.getImplicitPreferences(userId);
    
    // Merge preferences with appropriate weighting
    return this.mergePreferences(explicitPreferences, implicitPreferences);
  }
  
  async updatePreferences(userId, preferences) {
    // Validate preferences
    this.validatePreferences(preferences);
    
    // Update in database
    await this.preferenceRepository.updateForUser(userId, preferences);
    
    // Publish event for feed system
    await this.eventBus.publish('preferences.updated', { userId });
    
    return true;
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for preference management functions. Integration tests for preference updates and event publishing. User acceptance testing with sample preference profiles to verify feed personalization works as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Preference Repository for Explicit Preferences [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a data access layer for storing and retrieving explicit user preferences from the database. This should handle preferences like topics, followed accounts, and content types.
### Details:
Create a PreferenceRepository class that interfaces with the database to store user preference data. Implement methods for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting preferences. Use a structured schema that allows for flexible preference types and values. Include transaction support for batch updates.

## 2. Implement Behavior Analysis Service for Implicit Preferences [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a service that analyzes user behavior data to infer implicit preferences. This should track actions like content views, likes, shares, and time spent to determine user interests.
### Details:
Create a BehaviorAnalysisService that processes user interaction events and converts them into weighted preference scores. Implement algorithms to identify patterns in user behavior and translate them to preference categories. Include decay functions for older interactions to prioritize recent behavior.

## 3. Develop Preference Merging Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create the logic to combine explicit and implicit preferences with appropriate weighting to generate a comprehensive user preference profile.
### Details:
Implement the mergePreferences method in UserPreferenceService that takes explicit and implicit preferences and combines them using configurable weights. Include conflict resolution strategies when explicit and implicit preferences contradict. Ensure the merged result maintains preference strength indicators and confidence scores.

## 4. Implement Preference Update API and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the API endpoints and validation logic for updating user preferences, ensuring that only valid preference data is stored.
### Details:
Implement the updatePreferences method in UserPreferenceService with comprehensive validation rules. Create REST API endpoints for preference management. Include validation for preference types, values, and constraints. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and transaction handling for atomic updates.

## 5. Implement Event Publishing for Preference Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create a system to notify other services (particularly the feed system) when user preferences change, enabling real-time feed updates.
### Details:
Implement event publishing in the UserPreferenceService using the eventBus. Create event schemas for preference updates with appropriate payload information. Implement retry logic for failed event publishing. Add configuration for different event channels based on deployment environment.
