# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Feed Personalization Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a service that personalizes feed content based on user preferences, behavior, and context.
# Details:
Create a personalization service that:
1. Combines explicit and implicit user preferences
2. Adapts to changing user interests over time
3. Considers contextual factors (time of day, device, location)
4. Balances personalization with content diversity

Implementation should include:
```
class FeedPersonalizationService {
  async personalizeItems(userId, feedItems) {
    // Get user preferences and context
    const preferences = await this.preferenceService.getPreferences(userId);
    const userContext = await this.contextService.getUserContext(userId);
    const userHistory = await this.userHistoryService.getRecentActivity(userId);
    
    // Score each item for personalized relevance
    const scoredItems = await Promise.all(feedItems.map(async (item) => {
      const baseScore = item.score || 1.0;
      
      // Calculate personalization factors
      const topicRelevance = this.calculateTopicRelevance(item, preferences.topics);
      const sourceAffinity = this.calculateSourceAffinity(item, userHistory);
      const contextualRelevance = this.calculateContextualRelevance(item, userContext);
      
      // Combine factors with weights
      const personalizationMultiplier = (
        (topicRelevance * 0.5) +
        (sourceAffinity * 0.3) +
        (contextualRelevance * 0.2)
      );
      
      return {
        ...item,
        score: baseScore * personalizationMultiplier,
        personalizationFactors: {
          topicRelevance,
          sourceAffinity,
          contextualRelevance
        }
      };
    }));
    
    // Sort by personalized score
    return scoredItems.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual personalization factors. Integration tests with sample user profiles to verify personalization effects. A/B testing to measure engagement improvements from personalization. User feedback collection to validate personalization quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Preference and Context Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create methods to fetch and integrate user preferences, context, and history data from respective services for personalization calculations.
### Details:
Implement the initial setup of the FeedPersonalizationService class with dependency injection for required services (preferenceService, contextService, userHistoryService). Create methods to fetch user data and properly handle async operations. Ensure proper error handling for cases where services might be unavailable.

## 2. Implement Topic Relevance Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop the algorithm to calculate topic relevance between feed items and user preferences.
### Details:
Implement the calculateTopicRelevance method that compares item topics/tags with user preferred topics. Use a similarity scoring approach that considers both exact matches and related topics. Consider implementing a weighted scoring system where more specific topic matches receive higher scores than general category matches.

## 3. Implement Source Affinity and Contextual Relevance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create algorithms to calculate source affinity based on user history and contextual relevance based on user context.
### Details:
Implement calculateSourceAffinity method that evaluates user's past interactions with content sources to determine affinity scores. Implement calculateContextualRelevance method that factors in time of day, device type, location, and other contextual factors to determine relevance. Both methods should return normalized scores between 0 and 1.

## 4. Implement Personalized Scoring and Ranking [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Develop the core personalization algorithm that combines multiple factors to calculate a final personalized score for each feed item.
### Details:
Implement the scoring logic in personalizeItems method that combines topicRelevance, sourceAffinity, and contextualRelevance with appropriate weights. Add logic to handle the base score of items and apply the personalization multiplier. Implement sorting logic to rank items by final score. Ensure the algorithm maintains a balance between personalization and diversity.

## 5. Implement Diversity and Freshness Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Add mechanisms to ensure content diversity and freshness in personalized feeds to prevent filter bubbles and content staleness.
### Details:
Extend the personalizeItems method to include diversity controls that prevent too many similar items from dominating the feed. Implement a time decay factor that gradually reduces the score of older content. Add a randomization factor to occasionally introduce new content types or sources that the user hasn't interacted with before. Create configuration options to adjust the balance between personalization and diversity.
