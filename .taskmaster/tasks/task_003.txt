# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Content Ingestion Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a service to ingest and process content from various sources for inclusion in the feed system.
# Details:
Build a scalable content ingestion service that:
1. Accepts content submissions via API
2. Validates and sanitizes incoming content
3. Processes media attachments (images, videos)
4. Extracts metadata and keywords
5. Stores content in the appropriate data store
6. Triggers events for feed update processing

Implementation should include:
```
// Sample pseudocode for content ingestion
class ContentIngestionService {
  async ingestContent(content, userId, metadata) {
    // Validate content
    const validationResult = this.validateContent(content);
    if (!validationResult.isValid) throw new ValidationError(validationResult.errors);
    
    // Process media if present
    const processedMedia = await this.processMedia(content.media);
    
    // Extract metadata
    const enhancedMetadata = this.extractMetadata(content);
    
    // Store in database
    const contentId = await this.contentRepository.store({
      userId,
      content: content.text,
      media: processedMedia,
      metadata: { ...metadata, ...enhancedMetadata },
      createdAt: new Date()
    });
    
    // Publish event for feed processing
    await this.eventBus.publish('content.created', { contentId, userId });
    
    return contentId;
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for content validation, media processing, and metadata extraction. Integration tests for the full ingestion flow. Load testing to ensure the service can handle peak content submission rates. Verify event publication for downstream processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Content Validation and Sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a validation module that checks incoming content for required fields, validates data types, and sanitizes content to prevent security issues like XSS attacks.
### Details:
Develop a ContentValidator class with methods for different validation rules. Implement sanitization using a library like DOMPurify. Create a validation pipeline that runs multiple checks in sequence and returns detailed error messages. Handle different content types (text, links, etc.) with specific validation rules. Include rate limiting checks to prevent spam.

## 2. Build Media Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a system to process, optimize, and store media attachments (images, videos) that are included with content submissions.
### Details:
Implement a MediaProcessor class that detects media types, validates formats, and processes each type appropriately. For images: resize, compress, and generate thumbnails. For videos: validate format, extract thumbnail, and prepare for streaming. Store processed media in cloud storage with appropriate metadata. Handle asynchronous processing for large media files.

## 3. Develop Metadata Extraction Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a service that extracts and enhances metadata from content, including keywords, entities, and semantic information.
### Details:
Implement a MetadataExtractor class that analyzes content text to identify keywords, topics, and entities. Use NLP techniques or external APIs for entity recognition and topic classification. Extract structured data like links, mentions, and hashtags. Generate searchable keywords for improved content discovery. Store metadata alongside content for efficient retrieval.

## 4. Implement Content Storage Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create a data access layer to store processed content and its associated metadata in the appropriate data stores.
### Details:
Develop a ContentRepository class that handles persistence of content and metadata. Design database schema with appropriate indexes for efficient retrieval. Implement transaction management to ensure data consistency. Create methods for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting content. Implement batch operations for efficient bulk processing. Consider using different storage solutions for different content types (e.g., document store for text, blob storage for media).

## 5. Create Event Publication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Implement a system to publish events when content is ingested, allowing downstream services to react to new content.
### Details:
Develop an EventPublisher class that sends notifications when content is created or updated. Implement a reliable messaging pattern using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka). Create event schemas for different content operations. Include relevant content metadata in events for downstream processing. Implement retry logic and dead letter queues for failed event publications. Add monitoring for event publication success/failure rates.
