# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Engagement Tracking System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a system to track user engagement with feed content and use this data to improve feed quality.
# Details:
Create an engagement tracking system that:
1. Captures user interactions (views, clicks, likes, comments, shares, time spent)
2. Processes and aggregates engagement metrics
3. Feeds data back to the recommendation algorithm
4. Provides analytics for content performance

Implementation should include:
```
class EngagementTrackingService {
  async trackEngagement(userId, contentId, engagementType, metadata = {}) {
    // Validate inputs
    this.validateEngagementData(userId, contentId, engagementType, metadata);
    
    // Record engagement event
    const engagementId = await this.engagementRepository.record({
      userId,
      contentId,
      type: engagementType,
      metadata,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    // Update aggregated metrics
    await this.metricsAggregator.updateMetrics(contentId, engagementType);
    
    // Publish event for recommendation system
    await this.eventBus.publish('engagement.recorded', {
      userId,
      contentId,
      engagementType
    });
    
    return engagementId;
  }
}
```

The system should use a time-series database for efficient storage and querying of engagement data, with appropriate aggregation for different time windows (hourly, daily, weekly).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for engagement recording and validation. Integration tests for the full tracking flow and metric updates. Performance testing to ensure the system can handle high volumes of engagement events. Verify that engagement data correctly influences feed content.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Engagement Event Capture System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to capture and validate various user engagement events including views, clicks, likes, comments, shares, and time spent on content.
### Details:
Implement the core EngagementTrackingService class with methods to validate and record engagement events. Create an engagement repository interface and implementation for storing events in a time-series database. Define engagement types and validation rules for each type. Implement the validateEngagementData method to ensure all required fields are present and valid before recording.

## 2. Develop Metrics Aggregation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Build a service that processes raw engagement events and aggregates them into meaningful metrics across different time windows.
### Details:
Implement the MetricsAggregator class that processes engagement events and updates aggregated metrics. Create data structures for storing metrics by content, user, and engagement type. Implement aggregation logic for different time windows (hourly, daily, weekly). Design efficient queries for retrieving aggregated metrics. Include background jobs for periodic re-aggregation of historical data.

## 3. Create Event Publishing System for Recommendation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a system to publish engagement events to the recommendation engine to improve content personalization.
### Details:
Implement the EventBus interface and a concrete implementation for publishing engagement events. Create event schemas for different engagement types. Implement retry logic and error handling for failed event publishing. Add configuration for event destinations including the recommendation system. Ensure events contain all necessary data for the recommendation algorithm to update user profiles.

## 4. Build Analytics Dashboard for Content Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create an analytics interface that displays engagement metrics and content performance data for content creators and system administrators.
### Details:
Implement API endpoints to retrieve aggregated engagement metrics. Create data visualization components for different metric types. Implement filtering and sorting capabilities for analyzing engagement data. Add export functionality for reports. Design dashboard views for different user roles (content creators vs. administrators).

## 5. Implement Real-time Engagement Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop a scalable pipeline for processing high volumes of engagement events in real-time to provide immediate feedback to the recommendation system.
### Details:
Implement a streaming processing pipeline using a technology like Kafka or Kinesis. Create consumers for real-time metrics updates. Implement windowed processing for rolling metrics calculation. Add monitoring and alerting for pipeline health. Design the system to handle peak loads during high traffic periods. Implement circuit breakers to prevent system overload.
