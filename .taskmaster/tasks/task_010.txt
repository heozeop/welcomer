# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Analytics and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Build a comprehensive analytics and monitoring system to track feed performance and user engagement metrics.
# Details:
Develop an analytics system that:
1. Tracks key performance indicators for the feed system
2. Monitors user engagement and satisfaction
3. Provides dashboards for visualizing metrics
4. Alerts on anomalies or performance issues

Implementation should include:
```
class FeedAnalyticsService {
  async recordFeedView(userId, feedItems, metadata = {}) {
    // Record feed impression
    await this.analyticsRepository.recordEvent('feed_view', {
      userId,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      feedSize: feedItems.length,
      feedItemIds: feedItems.map(item => item.id),
      metadata
    });
    
    // Update aggregated metrics
    await this.updateDailyMetrics('feed_views');
  }
  
  async generateDailyReport() {
    const metrics = await this.analyticsRepository.getAggregatedMetrics('daily');
    
    return {
      totalViews: metrics.feed_views || 0,
      averageEngagementRate: this.calculateEngagementRate(metrics),
      contentDiversityScore: await this.calculateDiversityScore(),
      topPerformingContent: await this.getTopPerformingContent(10),
      userRetentionRate: await this.calculateRetentionRate()
    };
  }
}
```

The system should use a combination of real-time metrics processing and batch analytics, with visualization through a dashboard tool like Grafana or Tableau.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for metrics calculations and aggregations. Integration tests for the full analytics pipeline. Verification that dashboards accurately reflect system behavior. Alerting tests to ensure proper notification of issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Event Tracking and Data Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core analytics service to track and store user interactions and system events. This includes implementing the event recording functionality and defining the schema for different event types.
### Details:
Implement the `FeedAnalyticsService` with methods to record various events like feed views, item clicks, and user engagement metrics. Create an `AnalyticsRepository` class to handle data storage. Define event schemas for different interaction types. Implement batch processing for high-volume events. Use a time-series database or analytics-optimized storage solution for efficient querying.

## 2. Build Metrics Aggregation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a system to aggregate raw event data into meaningful metrics and KPIs. This includes daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations as well as real-time counters.
### Details:
Implement the metrics calculation methods in `FeedAnalyticsService` including `updateDailyMetrics`, `calculateEngagementRate`, `calculateDiversityScore`, and `calculateRetentionRate`. Create scheduled jobs for regular aggregation of metrics. Implement caching for frequently accessed metrics. Design the database schema to efficiently store both raw events and aggregated metrics.

## 3. Implement Reporting and Dashboard Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create reporting endpoints and integration with visualization tools to display analytics data in dashboards. Implement the report generation functionality.
### Details:
Implement the `generateDailyReport` method and other reporting functions. Create REST API endpoints to expose metrics data. Develop integration with Grafana or Tableau using their respective APIs. Create dashboard templates with the most important KPIs. Implement data export functionality for offline analysis. Add user-specific reporting views based on permissions.

## 4. Develop Anomaly Detection and Alerting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a system to detect anomalies in metrics and performance data, and send alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded or unusual patterns are detected.
### Details:
Implement statistical models for anomaly detection on key metrics. Create configurable alert thresholds for different metrics. Develop notification channels (email, Slack, SMS) for alerts. Implement alert severity levels and escalation policies. Create a UI for alert configuration and management. Add historical tracking of alerts for pattern analysis.

## 5. Implement A/B Testing Framework for Feed Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Description: Develop a framework to conduct A/B tests on feed algorithms and UI changes, measuring their impact on user engagement and satisfaction metrics.
### Details:
Create an experiment configuration system to define test groups and variants. Implement user assignment to test groups with proper randomization and consistency. Develop metrics comparison tools to evaluate experiment results. Create statistical significance calculators for experiment outcomes. Implement a dashboard for experiment monitoring and results visualization. Add capability to gradually roll out successful changes.
