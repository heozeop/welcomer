## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (‚â• 20.10.0) - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose** (‚â• 2.0.0) - Included with Docker Desktop
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- At least **4GB RAM** available for containers
- **10GB disk space** for images and volumes

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd welcome

# Verify Docker is running
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### 2. Start the Development Environment

**Option A: Using Makefile (Recommended)**
```bash
# Quick start for new developers (cleans, builds, starts, opens UIs)
make quick-start

# Or start all services
make start

# Or start with fresh build
make build
```

**Option B: Using Scripts Directly**
```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/start.sh

# Or start with specific options
./scripts/start.sh --env dev --build
```

### 3. Verify Installation

After starting, check that services are running:

**Using Makefile:**
```bash
# Check service status and health
make health

# View logs
make logs

# Open all management UIs in browser
make ui
```

**Using Scripts/Docker:**
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
./scripts/logs.sh

# Check application health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

./scripts/start.sh
./scripts/stop.sh
./scripts/logs.sh
./scripts/reset-db.sh
./scripts/clean.sh

# Environment management
./scripts/start.sh -e test
./scripts/start.sh -s "mysql redis app"
```

### Gradle Tasks

```bash
# Application development
make gradle-build           # Build project
make gradle-test            # Run tests  
make gradle-clean           # Clean build
make app-run                # Run app locally (not Docker)

# Or use Gradle directly
./gradlew bootRun
./gradlew test
./gradlew build
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The system uses `.env` files for configuration:

- `.env` - Development environment (default)
- `.env.test` - Testing environment
- `.env.staging` - Staging environment

Key configuration options:

```bash
# Database Configuration
MYSQL_DATABASE=welcomer_db
MYSQL_USER=welcomer
MYSQL_PASSWORD=devpassword

# Application Configuration  
APP_PORT=8080
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
DEBUG_PORT=5005

# Service Versions
KAFKA_VERSION=7.4
ELASTIC_VERSION=8.15.0
```

### Custom Configuration

The single `docker-compose.yml` file includes both core services and development management tools. For production deployments, you can:

1. **Use environment-specific files**: Create `docker-compose.prod.yml` with production overrides
2. **Override via environment variables**: All settings are configurable through `.env` files
3. **Exclude development services**: Use `docker-compose up` with specific service names

Example for production override file:
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
      - LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT=WARN
  # Remove development tools by not including them
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
./gradlew test

# Integration tests
./gradlew integrationTest

# Test with specific environment
./scripts/start.sh -e test
./gradlew test --tests="*IntegrationTest"
```

### Test Data

The system includes initialization scripts that create test data:

- **MySQL**: See `init-scripts/mysql/01-init.sql`
- **MongoDB**: See `init-scripts/mongodb/01-init.js`

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

All services include health checks:

```bash
# Check application health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Check all service health  
docker-compose ps
```

### Logs

```bash
# View all logs
./scripts/logs.sh

# Follow application logs
./scripts/logs.sh -s app -f

# View specific service logs
./scripts/logs.sh -s mysql -n 50
```

### Metrics

Application metrics are available at:
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus (Prometheus format)

## üîí Security Notes

### Development vs Production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The single `docker-compose.yml` file is configured for **development only** and includes:

- Default passwords and weak credentials
- Disabled security features (Elasticsearch security disabled)
- Exposed management interfaces (phpMyAdmin, Mongo Express, etc.)
- Debug ports and development tools enabled

**Never use this configuration in production!**

For production, create a separate `docker-compose.prod.yml` that excludes development services and enables security features.

### Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Create separate `docker-compose.prod.yml` without development services
- [ ] Change all default passwords in production environment files
- [ ] Enable TLS/SSL for all services
- [ ] Enable Elasticsearch security (`xpack.security.enabled=true`)
- [ ] Configure proper authentication for all services
- [ ] Remove development management UIs (phpMyAdmin, Mongo Express, etc.)
- [ ] Disable debug ports and development features
- [ ] Configure proper firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Use production-grade resource limits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services won't start:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check available resources
docker system df

# Clean up if needed
./scripts/clean.sh -f
```

**Database connection errors:**
```bash
# Check database health
docker-compose ps
./scripts/logs.sh -s mysql

# Reset databases if needed
./scripts/reset-db.sh -d mysql
```

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8080
lsof -i :3306

# Stop conflicting services or change ports in .env file
```

**Out of disk space:**
```bash
# Clean up Docker
docker system prune -a
./scripts/clean.sh -a -f

# Check disk usage
docker system df
```

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs: `./scripts/logs.sh`
2. Verify service health: `docker-compose ps`
3. Review configuration in `.env` files
4. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions
